A copy of the original gene X is placed on a plasmid with marker Y.\n3. The wild-type gene X (from the plasmid) replaces the mutated version using marker Z.\n4. Then, it's grown in presence of compound A and absence of Z to remove the plasmid copy.\n\nLet’s break down what each part means:\n\n### Markers:\n- **URA3**: Encodes an enzyme required for uracil biosynthesis; allows growth on minimal medium if functional.\n- **LEU2**: Required for leucine synthesis; needed for growth in leucine-free media.\n- **5'-FOA (5-fluoroorotic acid)**: A selectable marker that works via the URA3 gene — when URA3 is present, cells are resistant to 5-FOA.\n\n### Strategy:\nThe scientist uses homologous recombination to replace a genomic locus with either:\n- The wild-type version of gene X (from plasmid), or\n- The mutated version.\n\nThey use two markers:\n1. One on the plasmid (marker Y) – likely used for selection.\n2. One in the genome (marker Z) – also involved in replacement strategy.\n\nThen, they grow cells under conditions where **A** is present and **Z** is absent to remove the plasmid copy — meaning that only the integrated gene remains.\n\nIf the strain fails to grow after removing the plasmid, this implies:\n- The mutation M must be **lethal**, because if it were neutral or beneficial, there would be no reason for failure.\n- If marker Z was used in a way such as being part of the selection system (e.g., URA3), then its removal should allow growth only if the plasmid copy is removed and replaced by a functional gene.\n\nSo:\n- **M** must be lethal — otherwise, it wouldn’t cause failure to grow.\n- The plasmid has marker Y; let's say this is **URA3**, which allows growth in minimal medium (if not disrupted).\n- Marker Z must be something that gets removed or replaced. If the strain fails to grow after removing the plasmid with A and no Z, then it suggests:\n    - The original gene was functional.\n    - But now there's a mutation M replacing it — so if this is lethal, the cell dies unless rescued by some other mechanism.\n\nBut wait: they're trying to **replace** the mutated version of X in the genome using a plasmid with wild-type X. So:\n- The plasmid contains wild-type gene X + marker Y.\n- They replace the mutated gene (X) in the genome with this plasmid construct via homologous recombination.\n\nSo, if they grow cells in presence of A and absence of Z:\n- This likely removes or selects against the plasmid copy.\n- If it fails to grow, that means either:\n    - The mutation M is lethal (so even replacing it doesn’t help),\n    - Or there's a problem with how markers are being used.\n\nBut more importantly:\n\nWe're told:\n> \"He places a copy of the original gene X on a plasmid with a marker Y.\"\n\nAnd then later:\n> \"Then, he replaces X in the genome with the mutated version using another marker Z.\"\n\nSo:\n- Plasmid has wild-type gene X + **marker Y**\n- Genome gets replaced by mutated gene X via **marker Z**\n\nNow, when growing in presence of A and absence of Z:\n- The plasmid copy is removed.\n- If it fails to grow → the mutation M must be lethal.\n\nSo:\n\n### Final Logic:\n- Mutation M = Lethal\n- Marker Y (on plasmid) likely URA3 or LEU2 — but since we're talking about 5'-FOA resistance, and that's tied to **URA3**, it makes sense.\n- So Y = URA3\n- Z must be something else like LEU2 or another selectable marker.\n\nBut wait:\n> \"He then replaces X in the genome with the mutated version using another marker Z.\"\n\nSo he uses a plasmid containing wild-type gene + marker Y, and integrates it into the genome via homologous recombination. Then he removes that plasmid (using A and no Z). But if the strain fails to grow after removal of plasmid, then:\n- Either:\n    - The mutation M is lethal.\n    - Or there's an issue with how markers work.\n\nBut since it says \"he replaces X in the genome with the mutated version\", that means he starts with a **mutant** gene and tries to replace it with wild-type. If this fails, then maybe even replacing it doesn't help — so M must be lethal.\n\nSo:\n- M = Lethal\n- Y = URA3 (to allow growth in minimal medium)\n- Z = LEU2 or something else\n\nWait: Let’s re-read carefully:\n\n> \"He places a copy of the original gene X on a plasmid with a marker Y.\"\n\nThis is **not** about replacing — it's placing a wild-type version.\n\nThen:\n> \"He then replaces X in the genome with the mutated version using another marker Z.\"\n\nSo he starts with a mutant strain, and wants to replace that with wild-type. But instead of doing so directly (which would be tricky), he uses homologous recombination from plasmid containing wild-type gene + marker Y.\n\nThen:\n> \"He grows the strain in presence of A and in the absence of Z, to remove the copy on the plasmid.\"\n\nSo:\n- He removes the plasmid.\n- If it fails to grow → mutation M is lethal (because even replacing with wild-type doesn’t work).\n\nBut wait — if he replaces a **mutant** gene X with a **wild-type** one and still fails, then that means:\n- The original strain had a **lethal mutation**\n- Even correcting it didn't help\n\nSo the answer must be:\n\n### Lethal Mutation M\nMarkers:\n- Y = URA3 (allows growth in minimal medium)\n- Z = LEU2 or something else — but since he removes plasmid using A and no Z, that implies Z is a selectable marker.\n- And A likely refers to 5'-FOA which kills cells with functional URA3.\n\nSo:\nIf the strain fails to grow after removing plasmid (i.e., only integrated gene remains), then:\n\nLet’s match options now:\n\n#### Option D: Lethal, URA3, LEU2, 5'-FOA\n\nThis fits best:\n- M is lethal\n- Y = URA3 — allows growth in minimal medium\n- Z = LEU2 — used for integration or selection\n- A = 5'-FOA — kills cells with functional URA3 (so if plasmid removed, and only integrated gene remains, but still can't grow → mutation is lethal)\n\n✅ Correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\n**D**", "passed": false,
