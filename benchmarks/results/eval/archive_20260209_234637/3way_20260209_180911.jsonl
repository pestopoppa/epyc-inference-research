It involves two fermion lines meeting at a point, which is allowed by the SM Lagrangian.\n\nB) gg->gg: This represents gluon-gluon scattering and occurs via a three-gluon vertex in QCD (which is part of the SM). The interaction happens through a single vertex where two gluons couple to another pair of gluons. So, this can occur at a single SM vertex.\n\nC) HH->HH: This process involves Higgs boson interactions. In the SM, there are cubic and quartic self-couplings for the Higgs field (H→HH). However, these couplings involve either one or three Higgs particles in the interaction vertices, not four. Therefore, a direct four-body vertex involving only Higgs bosons does not exist at a single SM vertex.\n\nD) WW->WW: This is a W-boson scattering process that can occur via various mechanisms including t-channel and u-channel exchanges of other particles like fermions or gauge bosons, but it also involves interactions through the W-W-Higgs coupling (which is part of the SM). The interaction vertices for this process do exist in the SM.\n\nBased on the above reasoning:\n\nC) HH->HH cannot occur at a single SM vertex because there is no four-body Higgs self-coupling vertex allowed by the Standard Model Lagrangian. \n\nThe answer is C.", "passed": true, "elapsed_seconds": 16.969036214984953, "error": null, "error_type": "none", "tokens_generated": 368, "tokens_generated_estimate": 354, "backend_task_id": 758943, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll", "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "delegation_events": [], "tools_success": null, "delegation_success": null, "routed_to": "frontdoor", "role_history": ["frontdoor"], "routing_strategy": "", "turns": 0, "tokens_used": 0, "formalization_applied": false, "cache_stats": null, "predicted_tps": 27.266605084643917, "generation_ms": 13496.363, "prompt_eval_ms": 0.0, "http_overhead_ms": 0.0}, "frontdoor:repl": {"role": "frontdoor", "mode": "repl", "answer": "C", "passed": false, "elapsed_seconds": 3.850555765966419, "error": null, "error_type": "none", "tokens_generated": 11, "tokens_generated_estimate": 1, "backend_task_id": 759327, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll", "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "delegation_events": [], "tools_success": null, "delegation_success": null, "routed_to": "frontdoor", "role_history": ["frontdoor"], "routing_strategy": "", "turns": 0, "tokens_used": 0, "formalization_applied": false, "cache_stats": null, "predicted_tps": 2.979419740742751, "generation_ms": 3691.994065011386, "prompt_eval_ms": 0.0, "http_overhead_ms": 0.0}, "architect_general:delegated": {"role": "architect_general", "mode": "delegated", "answer": "delegate to REPL for math/estimation. Compute in REPL:\nWhich one is not possible via a single SM Feynman diagram?\n\nThe question asks which of these four-body processes cannot occur at a single Standard Model vertex.\n\nIn particle physics, vertices represent interactions. The Standard Model has specific rules about which particles can interact with each other through the fundamental forces.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) qq→qq - This represents quark-quark scattering. In the Standard Model, quarks interact via the strong force (quantum chromodynamics), so this process is allowed and would occur at a single vertex involving gluons.\n\nB) gg→gg - This represents gluon-gluon scattering. Gluons are the gauge bosons of the strong interaction, and they do interact with each other in quantum chromodynamics. So this process is allowed.\n\nC) HH→HH - This represents Higgs-Higgs scattering. In the Standard Model, the Higgs field has a self-interaction term, so this process is possible through the Higgs self-coupling.\n\nD) WW→WW - This represents W boson-W boson scattering. The W bosons are gauge bosons of the weak interaction. While they do mediate weak interactions, I need to consider if there's any specific rule that would prevent their direct interaction in a single vertex.\n\nThe key insight is that in the Standard Model, particles interact through specific vertices. For four-body processes like these (2→2 scattering), we typically don't have them occurring at a single vertex; instead, they're part of more complex Feynman diagrams involving multiple vertices.\n\nHowever, for this question, I'm being asked to identify which process cannot occur via any single Standard Model interaction. This is about the allowed interactions in the SM Lagrangian.\n\nUpon further reflection:\n- Quark-quark scattering (A) can happen via gluon exchange.\n- Glue-glue scattering (B) involves multi-gluon vertices that are present in QCD.\n- Higgs-Higgs scattering (C) occurs through box diagrams and is allowed by the SM.\n- W boson-W boson scattering (D) would involve weak interaction vertices.\n\nThe key distinction here is that not all of these represent a single vertex diagram. For WW→WW, there isn't a direct coupling between W bosons at a single vertex in the Standard Model - they interact through intermediate particles like photons or Z bosons.\n\nSo my answer", "passed": true, "elapsed_seconds": 86.03320894599892, "error": null, "error_type": "none", "tokens_generated": 500, "tokens_generated_estimate": 500, "backend_task_id": 412681, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll", "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "delegation_events": [], "tools_success": null, "delegation_success": null, "routed_to": "architect_general", "role_history": ["architect_general"], "routing_strategy": "", "turns": 0, "tokens_used": 0, "formalization_applied": false, "cache_stats": null, "predicted_tps": 6.035276480723097, "generation_ms": 82846.246, "prompt_eval_ms": 0.0, "http_overhead_ms": 0.0}, "architect_coding:delegated": {"role": "architect_coding", "mode": "delegated", "answer": "C", "passed": false, "elapsed_seconds": 4.5980039139976725, "error": null, "error_type": "none", "tokens_generated": 3, "tokens_generated_estimate": 0, "backend_task_id": 0, "slot_progress_source": "", "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "delegation_events": [], "tools_success": null, "delegation_success": null, "routed_to": "architect_coding", "role_history": ["architect_coding"], "routing_strategy": "", "turns": 0, "tokens_used": 0, "formalization_applied": false, "cache_stats": null, "predicted_tps": 0.657766265567207, "generation_ms": 4560.890634020325, "prompt_eval_ms": 0.0, "http_overhead_ms": 0.0}}, "rewards": {"SELF:direct": 1.0, "SELF:repl": 0.0, "ARCHITECT": 1.0}, "metadata": {"tools_helped": false, "tools_neutral": false, "tools_hurt": true, "tool_advantage": -1, "suite": "gpqa", "cache_disabled": true, "architect_eval": {"general": {"passed": true, "elapsed_seconds": 86.03320894599892, "tokens_generated": 500, "predicted_tps": 6.035276480723097, "generation_ms": 82846.246, "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "role_history": ["architect_general"], "error": null, "error_type": "none"}, "coding": {"passed": false, "elapsed_seconds": 4.5980039139976725, "tokens_generated": 3, "predicted_tps": 0.657766265567207, "generation_ms": 4560.890634020325, "tools_used": 0, "tools_called": [], "role_history": ["architect_coding"], "error": null, "error_type": "none"}, "best": "architect_general", "heuristic_would_pick": "architect_general"}, "architect_role": "architect_general", "cost_metrics": {"SELF:direct": {"elapsed_seconds": 16.969036214984953, "tokens_generated": 368, "tokens_generated_estimate": 354, "predicted_tps": 27.266605084643917, "generation_ms": 13496.363, "backend_task_id": 758943, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll"}, "SELF:repl": {"elapsed_seconds": 3.850555765966419, "tokens_generated": 11, "tokens_generated_estimate": 1, "predicted_tps": 2.979419740742751, "generation_ms": 3691.994065011386, "tools_used": 0, "backend_task_id": 759327, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll"}, "ARCHITECT": {"elapsed_seconds": 86.03320894599892, "tokens_generated": 500, "tokens_generated_estimate": 500, "predicted_tps": 6.035276480723097, "generation_ms": 82846.246, "role_history": ["architect_general"], "backend_task_id": 412681, "slot_progress_source": "slots_poll"}}, "all_infra": false}, "rewards_injected": 3}
