[title] Trace the whole outline of your feet.\n\nThis matches well with \"Trace your foot onto a piece of paper\" and continues logically from there. The other options don't make as much sense or are less coherent in terms of instructional flow for tracing one's foot to get accurate measurements when ordering shoes online where precise fit is important (like getting them traced properly).
