The solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄.\n2. There are two singlet signals at around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio — these correspond to protons on the aromatic ring that are equivalent due to symmetry.\n3. There are three singlet signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio — these likely represent methyl groups (–CH₃) or other saturated carbons.\n\nWe'll consider each compound's structure and how many unique protons it has, especially focusing on:\n- Aromatic proton equivalence\n- Methyl group signals\n\nLet’s examine the structures:\n\n### Compound Structures Analysis:\n\n#### 1. **1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene**\nThis is also known as **1,2,3,4-TMB**.\nIt has a symmetrical arrangement of four methyl groups around the benzene ring.\n- Aromatic protons: All equivalent due to symmetry → one signal at ~6.7 ppm\n- Methyl signals (–CH₃): 2 distinct types because there are two sets of chemically inequivalent CH₃s:\n   - Two CH₃ on C1 and C4 (or similar)\n   - Two CH₃ on C2 and C3\n\nSo, this compound gives rise to **two signals at ~6.7 ppm** (aromatic) and **three distinct methyl signals**, but only two unique methyl environments.\n\nWait — let's recheck the symmetry carefully:\n\nActually, in 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene:\n- The ring is symmetrically substituted.\n- There are four CH₃ groups at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 (relative to each other).\n- Due to this arrangement, there are **two distinct types of aromatic protons** (each pair equivalent), so one signal at ~6.7 ppm.\n- For methyls: two sets:\n   - One set with two CH₃s in the same environment\n   - Another set with two CH₃s in another environment\n\nSo, this compound gives rise to **one aromatic singlet** and **two different methyl signals**, but since it's a 1:1 mixture, we expect more complexity.\n\nBut wait — if both compounds give one signal at ~6.7 ppm (due to symmetry), then the total number of signals from two such compounds would be:\n- Two aromatic signals → but they are identical in nature.\nSo this doesn’t fit well with having **two distinct aromatic singlets** at 6.7 ppm.\n\n#### 2. **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**\nThis is also known as **1,2,3,5-TMB**.\nIt has a symmetric substitution pattern:\n- Two CH₃ on C1 and C4\n- Two CH₃ on C2 and C3\n\nSo again:\n- Aromatic protons: one signal at ~6.7 ppm (symmetrically equivalent)\n- Methyls: two sets of chemically equivalent methyl groups → 2 signals at ~2.2 ppm\n\nStill not matching the required pattern.\n\n#### 3. **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene**\nThis is also known as **1,2,4,5-TMB**.\nIt has a symmetric substitution:\n- Two CH₃ on C1 and C4\n- Two CH₃ on C2 and C3\n\nSame issue — only one aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm.\n\n#### 4. **1,4-diethylbenzene**\nThis is an ethyl-substituted benzene.\nStructure: C₆H₄(C₂H₅)₂\n- Two ethyl groups on opposite (para) positions → highly symmetric\n- Aromatic protons: one signal at ~6.7 ppm\n- Ethyl signals:\n   - Methylene (–CH₂–): 2 signals (one for each –CH₂–)\n   - Methyl (–CH₃): 1 signal\n\nSo, this compound gives rise to **one aromatic singlet** and **three distinct methyl/methylene signals**, which matches the pattern of three signals at ~2.2 ppm.\n\nNow let's reconsider all combinations:\n\nWe need:\n- Two different compounds that together give two signals at ~6.7 ppm (each contributing one signal)\n- Three signals at ~2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio\n\nLet’s try pairing each compound with another and see which fits best.\n\n### Pairing Options:\n\n#### Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nBoth are symmetrically substituted.\nEach gives one aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm → total of two signals (but same type)\nNot helpful.\n\n#### Option B: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,4-diethylbenzene\n- 1,2,3,5-TMB:\n   - One aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm\n   - Two methyl signals (but not enough)\n- Diethylbenzene:\n   - One aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm\n   - Three distinct methyl/methylene signals\n\nSo total: one aromatic signal from 1,2,3,5-TMB and one from diethylbenzene → two aromatic singlets.\nMethyls: Two sets of CH₃ (from 1,2,3,5-TMB) + three sets from ethyl group = five signals at ~2.2 ppm.\n\nBut we only have **three** signals at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio — so not matching.\n\n#### Option C: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene\nSame as before:\n- Both give one aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm → two signals total.\n- Methyls from both = four different methyl environments.\n\nStill not matching the exact pattern of three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.\n\n#### Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene + 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene\nSame logic applies — both give one aromatic signal at ~6.7 ppm.\nMethyls = four different methyl environments → more than three.\n\nWait! Let’s recheck carefully:\n\nActually, in **1,2,4,5-TMB**, the structure is:\n- C₁–CH₃, C₂–CH₃, C₄–CH₃, C₅–CH₃\nBut this means four CH₃s on positions 1, 2, 4, and 5.\nThis gives **two equivalent pairs** of methyl groups:\n   - One pair at C₁ and C₄ (symmetrically placed)\n   - Another pair at C₂ and C₅\n\nSo that’s two unique methyl environments → one signal.\n\nSimilarly for 1,2,3,4-TMB:\n- Positions 1, 2, 3, 4\n- Two pairs of equivalent CH₃s (C₁=C₄ and C₂=C₃)\n\nThus, both give **one aromatic singlet** at ~6.7 ppm.\nAnd each gives **two methyl signals**, so together they give:\n- One aromatic signal from each → two total\n- Four methyl signals in all\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait — let’s think differently!\n\nWe are told that the NMR shows:\n\n1. Two signals at around 6.7 ppm (both singlets) in a **1:1 ratio**\n2. Three signals at around 2.2 ppm (all singlets) in a **2:1:1 ratio**\n\nSo, we must have:\n- One compound contributing one aromatic signal\n- Another compound also contributing one aromatic signal → total of two signals\n\nThat means the compounds must be such that each contributes exactly one unique aromatic proton set.\n\nOnly possible if both are symmetrically substituted with same number and arrangement — but then how do you get **two different aromatic singlets**?\n\nActually, no. The key is in the symmetry:\n\nIf we have a 1:1 mixture of two compounds:\n- One compound gives rise to signal A at ~6.7 ppm\n- Another compound gives rise to signal B at ~6.7 ppm\n\nSo if one compound has **one aromatic proton set**, and another also has **one aromatic proton set** (but different from the first), then we get two signals.\n\nBut in a 1:1 mixture, both compounds contribute equally — so each contributes one signal → total of two signals at ~6.7 ppm.\n\nSo now let’s look for which pair gives:\n- Two aromatic singlets\n- Three methyl singlets (in 2:1:1 ratio)\n\nLet's go back to the actual structures and count:\n\n### Let’s take Option D again:\n\n#### Compound 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene  \nStructure = C₆H₃(CH₃)₄\n- Positions 1, 2, 4, 5 have CH₃s.\n- Aromatic ring has symmetry → one signal at ~6.7 ppm (all aromatic protons equivalent)\n- Methyl groups:\n   -
