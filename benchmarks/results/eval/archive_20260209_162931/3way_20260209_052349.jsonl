The 1H NMR data shows 3 signals: 1 singlet and 2 triplets. This suggests that there are two sets of equivalent protons that are coupled to each other (triplets) and one set of protons that has no coupling (singlet). \n\nThe molecular formula of compound B is C4H6, with the NMR data showing 3 signals: 1 singlet, 1 triplet, and 1 quartet. This indicates a terminal alkyne group (-C≡C-H) where one proton is not coupled to any other protons (singlet), while another set of protons are coupled to form triplets or quartets.\n\nFor compound C with the formula C10H18, there are 5 signals in its NMR spectrum: 1 singlet, 3 triplets, and a quartet. This pattern is consistent with an alkene or alkyne where some protons are not coupled (singlet), others form triplets due to coupling with adjacent protons, and one set forms a quartet from coupling with three equivalent hydrogens.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) The proposed reaction involves 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane reacting with 3-methylbut-1-yne. This would produce an alkene or alkyne product that matches the NMR data for C.\nB) Electrophilic substitution is not consistent with these reagents and products.\nC) The proposed reaction involves 1-bromo-3,3-dimethylbutane reacting with but-1-yne to form a product with an incorrect number of carbon atoms in the main chain according to the NMR data for C.\nD) Addition reactions typically involve alkenes or alkynes adding across double bonds and would not produce this specific pattern.\n\nThe correct answer is A. The reaction described involves nucleophilic substitution between 3-bromo-2,4-dimethylpentane (A) and 3-methylbut-1-yne (B), forming the product C with a different arrangement of carbon atoms that matches the NMR data provided. \n\nA\n\nThe molecular formula of compound A is C6H13Br.
