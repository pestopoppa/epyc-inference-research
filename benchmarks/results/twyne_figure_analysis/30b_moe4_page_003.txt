### 1. What type of visualization is this?

This is a **comparative diagram** or **conceptual model**. It is not a traditional chart like a bar graph or pie chart. Instead, it uses a diagrammatic, flow-like structure to compare two different financial systems—traditional lending markets and the Twyne protocol—by illustrating the flow of capital and borrowing power.

### 2. What are the key components shown?

The diagram is structured as a comparison between two main entities or systems, which can be broken down into the following key components:

-   **Credit-LP (Credit Lending Protocol):** This represents the traditional or established lending market.
    -   **Borrowing Capacity:** This is the total amount of capital a user can borrow, which is a function of their collateral.
    -   **Locked:** This represents the capital that a user has deposited as collateral, which is locked in the protocol.
    -   **Delegated Borrowing Capacity:** This is the core concept of the diagram. It represents the *unused* portion of a user's borrowing power that can be "borrowed" or delegated to another user.

-   **Borrower:** This represents a user who is seeking to borrow capital.
    -   **Own Borrowing Capacity:** This is the amount of capital the borrower can borrow based on their own collateral.
    -   **New Borrowing Capacity:** This is the *total* amount the borrower can access.
    -   **Delegated Borrowing Capacity:** This is the amount of capital the borrower gains by utilizing the *unused* borrowing power of a Credit LP.
    -   **Locked:** This represents the capital the borrower has deposited as collateral.

### 3. What is the main insight?

The **main insight** of the diagram is that **a user (the Borrower) can access a significantly higher level of borrowing power by leveraging the unused credit of other users (Credit LPs) within a single, unified protocol (Twyne), rather than relying solely on their own collateral.**

This is a fundamental shift from traditional DeFi lending, where a user's borrowing limit is directly tied to their own collateral. The diagram illustrates that Twyne allows a Borrower to:
-   **Boost their borrowing limit:** By "borrowing" the unused borrowing power of a Credit LP, the Borrower can access a higher total amount of capital than they
