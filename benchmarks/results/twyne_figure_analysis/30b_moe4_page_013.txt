### 1) Type of Figure

This is a **line chart** that visualizes **interest rate curves** in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. More specifically, it is a **parametric model** of these curves, designed to show how the interest rate for borrowing assets changes as a function of the network's **utilization rate** (the percentage of the total supply of a given asset that is currently borrowed).

The chart compares the interest rate model from the **Keom Protocol** (the solid and dashed curves) against a **linear kink model** (the dash-dotted line) and other variations. The primary purpose of the figure is to demonstrate the behavior and performance of the Keom Protocol's interest rate model under different conditions.

### 2) Key Components

The chart and its caption contain several key components that define the system being modeled:

- **Y-Axis (Vertical):** Labeled "Interest Rate (%)". This represents the borrowing cost for users. The scale is from 0% to over 120%.
- **X-Axis (Horizontal):** Labeled "Utilization Rate (%)". This represents the percentage of the total supply of an asset that is currently borrowed. It ranges from 0% to 100%.
- **Data Series (Curves):**
    - **Interest Rate, γ=18, γ=16, γ=10:** These are the primary model curves for the Keom Protocol. The parameter `γ` (gamma) controls the "curviness" of the interest rate function. A higher `γ` results in a steeper, more curved (quadratic) relationship between interest rate and utilization. The model is designed to be quasi-linear at low utilization and then ramp up quickly
