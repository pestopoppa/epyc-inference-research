Here is an analysis of the figure from the DeFi whitepaper:

---

**1. What type of visualization is this?**

This is a **line chart** (or plot), specifically a **function plot** showing how a variable (liquidation incentive) changes as a function of another variable (LTV at liquidation). It compares two different interpolation functions (linear and quadratic) over a range of LTV values.

---

**2. What are the key components or data series shown?**

The chart displays two distinct data series:

- **Blue dashed line**: Represents the **linear interpolation function**, defined as `f(x) = x`. This is the “linear interpolator” mentioned in the legend.
- **Red dashed line**: Represents the **quadratic interpolation function**, defined as `f(x) = x · (2 - x)`. This is the “quadratic interpolator”.

The x-axis is labeled “LTV at Liquidation (λₜ)”, ranging from 0.800 to 1.000. The y-axis is labeled “Liquidation Incentive (iₜ(λₜ))”, ranging from 0.00 to 0.06.

The chart also includes a legend in the top-right corner that identifies each line.

**3. What is the main insight or takeaway?**

The main insight is that **the shape of the liquidation incentive curve is sensitive to the interpolation function chosen**:

- Both functions start at 0 incentive when LTV is just above the safety threshold (0.825).
- The **quadratic function (red)** reaches a peak incentive of 0.05 at LTV = 0.95, then declines symmetrically.
- The **linear function (blue)** rises steadily, reaching 0.05 at LTV = 0.95, then declines linearly to 0.
