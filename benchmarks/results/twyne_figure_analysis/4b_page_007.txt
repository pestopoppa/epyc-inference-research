Based on the provided image from a DeFi whitepaper, here is the analysis:

1.  **Type of Visualization:**
    This is a **diagram** (specifically, a block diagram or conceptual diagram). It uses rectangular blocks to represent different financial components and lines/labels to show relationships and perspectives. It is not a statistical plot or chart but a schematic illustrating the conceptual difference between two viewpoints.

2.  **Key Components or Data Series Shown:**
    The diagram illustrates the comparison between two perspectives on Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios within the Twyne protocol:
    *   **Internal LTV Perspective (95%):** Represented by a large block labeled "$100 Deposited Collateral" and a smaller block below it labeled "$95 Possible to Borrow". The text "95% Internal LTV Perspective excludes delegated credit" indicates this is the borrower's view, where only the deposited collateral is considered for the LTV calculation.
    *   **External LTV Perspective (86%):** Represented by a smaller, shaded block labeled "$10 Delegated Credit" positioned above the "$100 Deposited Collateral" block. The text "86% External LTV perspective includes delegated credit" indicates this is the protocol's view, which includes delegated credit as part of the total collateral.
