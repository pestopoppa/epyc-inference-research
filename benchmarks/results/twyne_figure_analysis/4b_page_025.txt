Here is an analysis of Figure 9 from the DeFi whitepaper:

---

**1. What type of visualization is this?**

This is a **contour plot** (or heatmap) with **color-coded loss values** and **two overlayed regions** (a theoretical frontier and a profitability region). It is a 2D surface plot where the x-axis and y-axis represent two variables, and the color gradient represents a third variable (loss). The plot also includes a black dashed line (theoretical frontier) and a yellow hatched region (profitability region), which are both defined by specific conditions.

**2. What are the key components or data series shown?**

- **X-axis (Liquidity Incentive, `i`)**: Ranges from 0.00 to 0.07. This represents the incentive offered to liquidators to trigger a liquidation.
- **Y-axis (Closing Factor, `c`)**: Ranges from 0.00 to 1.0. This represents the factor by which the collateral is “sanitized” or reduced after a liquidation.
- **Color Bar (CLP Loss)**: Shows the magnitude of the Credit LP (CLP) loss, ranging from -0.7 (highest loss, 70%) to 0.0 (no loss). The color gradient is from red (high loss) to blue (low loss).
- **Black Dashed Line**: The “Theoretical CLP-loss Frontier,” derived from Equation 38, which models the minimum possible loss given the dynamic liquidation incentive mechanism.
- **Yellow Hatched Region**: The “Relative Profitability Region (pt > 1)”, indicating where rational liquidators would act regardless of fallback liquidations being available.
- **Yellow Vertical Line**: Marks the point where the incentive `i` is 0.04, possibly indicating a threshold or boundary condition.
