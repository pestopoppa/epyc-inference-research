What monitoring would have detected this before it affected customers? 1. Double-charges occurred due to the lack of an idempotency check in the write operation. The system checks for an idempotency key on the read side, but does not have an idempotency check on the write side. This means that if the same transaction is double-charged, it would be caught by the system on the read side, but not on the write side.

To determine whether the statement \"If P -> Q and Q -> R, then P -> R\" is true, we need to analyze the logical implications between the three statements. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: \"P -> Q\" means that if P is true, then Q must be true. Similarly, \"Q -> R\" means that if Q is true, then R must be true.\n\nStep 2: \"P -> Q\" and \"Q -> R\" implies that if P is true, then Q is true, and if Q is true, then R is true. \n\nStep 3: We don't have enough information to prove that P -> R is true, as we only have two statements, and no information about the relationship between P and R.\n\nIn conclusion, we can't prove that \"P -> R\" is true, as we don't have enough information to support it. Therefore, the statement \"If P -> Q and Q -> R, then P -> R\" is not necessarily true.\n\nTo disprove the statement, we can provide a counterexample. For example, if P is true, then Q is false, and if Q is false, then R is true. In this case, P -> Q is false, but Q -> R is true, which disproves the statement. [end of text]",
