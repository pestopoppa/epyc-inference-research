What monitoring would have detected this before it affected customers? 1. Double-Charges Occurred Due to:\n   - The primary key in the transaction was not marked as idempotent, allowing it to be used multiple times.\n   - The read/replica setup does not prevent double-charges, as it is common for a read/replica setup to be used for read/replica in the same transaction.\n   - The transaction is not marked as idempotent, allowing it to be used multiple times.\n\n2. The team did not catch this in testing because:\n   - They did not have enough time to test the entire system, and the team did not have enough time to test the entire system.\n   - They did not have enough time to test the entire system, and the team did not have enough time to test the entire system.\n\n3. Two different architectural fixes:\n   - The team should have used an idempotency key for the transaction and marked it as such.\n   - The team should have used an idempotency key for the transaction and marked it as such.\n   - The team should have used an idempotency key for the transaction and marked it as such.\n\n4.

You may not use the formula for speed, time, distance, or the speed formula. You may not use the formula for speed, time, distance, or the speed formula.\nTo answer this question, you must understand that a frame of time or a date that is written in between the digits 1\u20139, such as 1\u20132, 1\u201323, or 1\u20132/3, is a fraction of the time of the day (i.e., 1\u20132=1:00\u20131:15 = 1:15 or 1\u201323=1:00\u20131:15:30 = 1:15:30). That is, a time of the day. Also, remember that the second time date or time of day is the same as the second day. For example: 1\u201323 is part of 1\u201323 or 1\u20132/3 is part of 1\u201323. This is a time of day, not a date. For dates, please follow the template for this question on the first day of the first month of the first year. For example: 1/2/3/4/13 is the date of 1/2/3/4/13. (If it seems clear, we have not met the date.) You may also use the date of 2/1/2/3/4/13. (If it seems clear, we have not met the date.) Please note that an ordinal date or a date that is written with digits after a slash, such as 2/3/4/13, is not part of 2/3/4/13. That is, an ordinal date is part of 2/3/4/13.
