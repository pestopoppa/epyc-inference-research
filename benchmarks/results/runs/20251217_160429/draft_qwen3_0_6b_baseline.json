The user is a company that has a policy to deploy ML models in production, but they might not be able to handle the models. For example, if the models are not properly trained, but the models are deployed in production. So maybe the models are not properly trained. Let me think of a possible scenario. The models are deployed in production, but they are not trained on the actual data. So maybe the models are not trained on the actual data. So the models are not trained on the actual data.

Show all your work. \n\nOkay, so the problem is that there are two trains leaving from two stations, and they're traveling towards each other. The stations are 280 miles apart. The first train leaves from Station A at 9:00 AM, going to Station B. The second train leaves from Station B at 10:00 AM, going to Station A. The time between the two trains meets is? So, I need to figure out the time when both trains meet the stations. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the two trains are traveling towards each other. So, they are moving towards each other. The stations are 280 miles apart. So, the total distance between the stations is 280 miles. \n\nLet me think. The first train leaves from Station A at 9:00 AM, going to Station B. The second train leaves from Station B at 10:00 AM, going to Station A. So, they are both leaving at the same time, but the direction is different. \n\nLet me try to model this.
