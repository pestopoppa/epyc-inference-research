thinking,t3_q1_methodological_critique,49.06,3,"Correctly identified 4+ methodological issues (selection bias/SES, test bias, expectancy bias, definition of bilingualism) with clear explanations of mechanisms. Proposed improved experimental design with RCT, controls, and blinding."
thinking,t3_q2_causal_inference,49.06,3,"Correctly identified minimal sufficient adjustment set as {Gene}, explained collider bias from Yellow Fingers, and provided alternative approaches for unmeasured confounders (IV, longitudinal methods, sensitivity analysis)."
thinking,t3_q3_reasoning_trap,49.06,3,Correctly identified test set representativeness flaw. Provided concrete medical imaging scenario showing D2 superior due to diversity/robustness despite lower accuracy on biased test set. Specific mechanism explained.
thinking,t2_q1_paradox,49.06,2,"Presented philosophical positions (Aquinas form-based, Lewis material continuity) with reasoning. Response truncated mid-sentence, incomplete conclusion. Good reasoning process but not fully executed."
thinking,t2_q2_counterfactual,49.06,3,"Analyzed all three dimensions (dissemination speed, collaboration, reproducibility) with specific mechanisms and second-order effects. Covered both positive and negative aspects as requested."
thinking,t2_q3_formal,49.06,3,"Provided formal proof using logical rules (modus ponens), truth table verification, and concrete examples. Correctly proved hypothetical syllogism (P→Q ∧ Q→R ⇒ P→R)."
thinking,t2_q4_metacognition,49.06,2,"Detailed Fermi estimation approach with clear steps (population, households, piano ownership, tuning frequency, tuner capacity). Response truncated before completing bounds and uncertainty analysis. Good reasoning but incomplete."
thinking,t1_q1_multistep,49.06,3,"Correct answer (11:34 AM). Showed full work with equation setup, solving for t=11/7 hours, verification via alternative method (relative speed), and proper time conversion."
thinking,t1_q2_hypothesis,49.06,2,"Identified multiple alternative explanations (SES, parental involvement, health/nutrition, regular sleep, peer influence, school resources). Response truncated mid-sentence. Good reasoning process but incomplete final answer."
thinking,t1_q3_planning,49.06,2,"Correctly analyzed constraints (A→B→D→C chain, DC block, E position 2-4). Systematic case analysis started, found valid orderings (ABEDC, AEBDC). Response truncated mid-analysis. Good approach but incomplete enumeration."
coder,t3_q1_concurrent_correctness,49.06,0,"Response loops repeatedly saying ""Wait, perhaps the ABA problem occurs when..."" without providing concrete sequence, incorrect behavior, or fix. No useful answer despite long response."
coder,t3_q2_distributed_consistency,49.06,2,"Listed 4 strategies (LWW, vector clocks, MVCC, quorum). Discussed scenarios with wrong behavior. Response truncated before completing recommendations for shopping cart and banking. Partial but reasonable analysis."
coder,t3_q3_algorithmic_hardness,49.06,2,Attempted Omega(n) proof (every element must be examined). Explained median-of-medians recurrence T(n)=T(n/5)+T(7n/10)+O(n) and significance of group size 5. Response truncated before completing randomized select analysis. Good start but incomplete.
coder,t2_q1_design,49.06,3,"Correct LRU cache implementation using dict + doubly linked list. Proper O(1) get/put operations. Clean code with helper methods, explanation of data structure choices, and test case."
coder,t2_q2_debug_complex,49.06,3,Correctly identified race condition (multiple tasks reading same counter value). Proper fix using asyncio.Lock() with async context manager. Clear explanation of atomic operation requirement.
coder,t2_q3_optimize,49.06,3,Optimized from O(n²) to O(n) using frequency dictionary. Correct logic for counting pairs with complement checking. Handles edge case where num == target/2. Clean implementation.
