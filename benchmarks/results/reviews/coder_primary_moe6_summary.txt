Key Findings
------------

Strengths:
- Excellent performance on coder suite (90.0%)
- Strong reasoning on thinking questions (76.7%)
- Good agentic/tool use responses (73.3%)
- Consistent output (0% empty or failed responses)
- Balanced performance across all suites (70-90%)
- No score=1 responses indicates consistent quality floor

Weaknesses:
- Math suite slightly lower (70.0%)
- Most responses scored as "partial" (72.1% with score=2)
- Some confusion on complex causal inference (T3 level)

Notable Performance:
- T3 methodological critique: Identified 6+ methodological issues
- T3 causal inference: Showed reasoning but with some confusion
- Coder tasks: Strong code generation, refactoring, and test writing
- Instruction precision: Good format compliance (72.7%)

Recommendations:
- Model performs well as a code specialist (90% on coder suite)
- Suitable for general reasoning tasks (73-77% on thinking/agentic)
- Good for instruction-following tasks (72.7%)
- Average speed of 17.56 t/s is acceptable for interactive use
- Overall 76% score indicates strong general capability
