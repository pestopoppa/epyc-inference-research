  "summary_raw": "**Executive Summary: Twyne V1 Protocol Overview**\n\nTwyne is a DeFi protocol designed to enhance capital efficiency and flexibility in decentralized credit markets by enabling dynamic resource allocation through credit delegation and a dual-LTV framework. Its primary purpose is to optimize liquidity utilization, improve risk management, and offer higher yields for participants in cross-lending environments.\n\nA key innovation is the **Credit-LP model**, where liquidity providers (Credit LPs) can delegate unused borrowing capacity into a locked reserve, earning additional yield via delegation APY. This mechanism allows for more efficient capital deployment and increased liquidity availability. The **dual-LTV framework** further enhances this by distinguishing between external and internal LTV perspectives, enabling borrowers to access higher loan-to-value ratios while maintaining safety from the protocol\u2019s standpoint.\n\nThe protocol operates through two core smart contracts: the **Credit Vault** and the **Collateral Vault**. Credit LPs deposit receipt tokens into the Credit Vault, which aggregates liquidity and delegates credit. Borrowers then deposit underlying assets and collateral into their respective vaults, using the delegated credit to initiate loans. This structure ensures secure, scalable, and interoperable credit issuance across DeFi ecosystems.\n\nFor **borrowers**, Twyne offers access to higher LTVs and flexible borrowing options, while **lenders** benefit from improved capital efficiency and yield generation through delegation. The system supports seamless integration with existing DeFi lending protocols, enhancing overall market liquidity.\n\nTwyne targets DeFi users seeking optimized credit access, including institutional and retail borrowers, as well as liquidity providers aiming to maximize returns in a capital-efficient environment."
