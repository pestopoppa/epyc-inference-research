  "summary": "Twyne V1 is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to enhance capital efficiency and yield optimization in lending markets through dynamic credit delegation and multi-layered risk management. At its core, Twyne enables borrowers to access on-demand collateral factors and cross-lending opportunities by aggregating and delegating credit from liquidity providers (LPs), creating a more flexible and capital-efficient lending environment than traditional protocols.\n\nThe protocol introduces two key innovations: credit delegation and a dual-LTV (Loan-to-Value) framework. Credit delegation allows Credit-LPs to allocate unused borrowing capacity to a liquidity pool, earning yield while maintaining the ability to reclaim or reallocate capital. The dual-LTV model presents two distinct LTV perspectives: an \u201cInternal LTV\u201d from the protocol\u2019s viewpoint and an \u201cExternal LTV\u201d from the underlying lending protocol\u2019s view. This allows borrowers to operate with higher effective LTVs\u2014up to 87% internally\u2014while remaining below risk thresholds externally, enhancing leverage without compromising collateralization safety.\n\nTwyne operates by integrating with existing DeFi lending protocols through two smart contract vaults: the Credit Vault, which pools and delegates credit from LPs, and the Collateral Vault, which manages borrower positions. Borrowers deposit collateral and underlying assets, while Credit LPs supply receipt tokens in exchange for yield. Twyne then uses these deposits to secure additional borrowing power across integrated protocols, enabling borrowers to tap into higher leverage than would otherwise be possible.\n\nFor borrowers, Twyne unlocks higher leverage, improved capital efficiency, and access to cross-protocol liquidity without liquidation risk from single-protocol LTV constraints. For lenders, it offers enhanced APY through delegated credit strategies and reduced impermanent risk compared to direct liquidity provision. The protocol\u2019s Linear Kink Model further optimizes yield curves, dynamically adjusting rates between 80% and 120% based on utilization, ensuring balanced incentives.\n\nTwyne targets sophisticated DeFi users, including yield farmers, liquidity providers, and leveraged traders seeking to maximize returns without sacrificing capital efficiency. It also appeals to protocols aiming to integrate permissionless, credit-based lending rails with improved capital utilization. By bridging fragmented lending markets under a unified credit layer, Twyne redefines how capital is deployed and leveraged in DeFi."
