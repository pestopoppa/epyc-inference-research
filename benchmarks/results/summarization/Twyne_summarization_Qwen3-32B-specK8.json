  "summary": "**Executive Summary**\n\nTwyne is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol designed to enhance capital efficiency and risk management in lending markets by introducing a novel credit delegation model. The platform\u2019s main thesis is to enable borrowers to access higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios while maintaining safety from the perspective of external protocols. This is achieved through a dual-LTV framework that distinguishes between internal and external risk assessments, allowing borrowers to leverage delegated credit without violating external collateral constraints.\n\nA key innovation of Twyne is its credit delegation mechanism, which allows liquidity providers (Credit LPs) to delegate unused borrowing capacity to borrowers. This creates a dynamic system where Credit LPs can earn additional yield through delegation APY, while borrowers gain access to more liquidity. The protocol integrates with existing DeFi lending platforms, using Credit Vaults and Collateral Vaults to manage liquidity, credit delegation, and risk. These vaults act as intermediaries between liquidity providers and borrowers, ensuring secure and efficient capital allocation.\n\nTwyne\u2019s architecture supports a lifecycle management system for borrower positions, including funding, active monitoring, rebalancing, and risk mitigation. The protocol also employs a Linear Kink Model to dynamically adjust interest rates based on utilization, ensuring fair and responsive yield distribution.\n\nFor borrowers, Twyne offers increased access to liquidity and flexibility in managing their positions. For lenders, it provides enhanced capital utilization and diversified risk exposure through credit delegation. The platform is particularly beneficial for DeFi users seeking to optimize their lending and borrowing strategies across multiple protocols.\n\nTwyne\u2019s target audience includes DeFi liquidity providers, borrowers, and institutional participants looking to improve capital efficiency and risk-adjusted returns in a trustless, decentralized environment."
