  ## Section 1: Introduction
  Machine learning has revolutionized how we approach data analysis.
  Traditional statistical methods are being augmented with neural networks.
  This shift has enabled breakthrough applications in computer vision and NLP.

  ## Section 2: Methods
  We employed a transformer-based architecture with 12 attention heads.
  Training was conducted on 8 GPUs over 72 hours using mixed precision.
  Data augmentation included random cropping and color jittering.

  ## Section 3: Results
  Our model achieved 94.2% accuracy on the test set, surpassing baseline.
  Ablation studies confirmed the importance of pre-training on diverse data.
  Inference speed was 15ms per sample on consumer hardware.
