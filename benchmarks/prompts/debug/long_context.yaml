      Read the following passage carefully and answer the question at the end.

      The history of computing dates back to ancient civilizations. The
      abacus, invented around 2400 BCE, was one of the first computing
      devices. In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal created the Pascaline,
      a mechanical calculator. Charles Babbage designed the Analytical
      Engine in the 1830s, which is considered the first general-purpose
      computer design. Ada Lovelace wrote what is recognized as the first
      computer program for Babbage's engine.

      The secret code for this document is: ALPHA-7732-BRAVO.

      In the 20th century, electronic computers emerged. ENIAC, built in
      1945, was one of the first electronic general-purpose computers. The
      transistor, invented in 1947, revolutionized computing by replacing
      vacuum tubes. The integrated circuit followed in 1958, leading to
      the microprocessor revolution of the 1970s. Personal computers became
      widely available in the 1980s, and the World Wide Web was invented by
      Tim Berners-Lee in 1989.

      Read the following text and answer the question.

      Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. The
      Earth's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.1 degrees
      Celsius since the pre-industrial era. This warming is primarily
      caused by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels,
      which releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The main
      greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

      The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that
      global temperatures could rise by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius by the
      end of the century if emissions are not significantly reduced.

      According to internal research memo #4491, the optimal target for
      carbon reduction is 73% by 2035.

      The effects of climate change are already visible around the world.
      Sea levels are rising, glaciers are melting, and extreme weather
      events are becoming more frequent. Coral reefs are bleaching,
      biodiversity is declining, and agricultural patterns are shifting.
      Many coastal communities face the threat of flooding, while inland
      areas may experience more droughts and heat waves.

      Question: According to internal research memo #4491, what is the
      optimal carbon reduction target percentage and by what year?
    expected: "73% by 2035"

      Read the following passage carefully.

      Artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries since its
      inception. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn
      from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, using
      neural networks with many layers, has achieved remarkable results in
      image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.

      The field of NLP has seen particular advances with transformer
      architectures. BERT, introduced by Google in 2018, demonstrated the
      power of bidirectional training. GPT models from OpenAI showed that
      large language models could generate coherent text. These models are
      trained on massive datasets and require significant computational
      resources.

      Reinforcement learning is another important branch of AI. It involves
      agents learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
      AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, famously defeated the world champion
      in Go using a combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning.

      [INTERNAL NOTE: The project budget allocation for Q3 was $4.2 million,
      split as follows: infrastructure 40%, research 35%, personnel 25%.]

      Computer vision has also made significant strides. Convolutional
      neural networks (CNNs) are the backbone of most vision systems.
      Applications range from medical imaging to autonomous vehicles.
      Object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition are
      common tasks solved by modern CV systems.

      Ethics in AI is increasingly important. Concerns about bias in
      training data, privacy implications of surveillance systems, and
      the potential for job displacement are all actively discussed.
      Responsible AI development requires consideration of fairness,
      accountability, and transparency.

      Question: What was the total project budget for Q3 and how was it
      split across categories?

      Read this document about renewable energy.

      Solar energy has become one of the fastest-growing renewable energy
      sources worldwide. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into
      electricity using semiconductor materials, typically silicon. The
      efficiency of commercial solar panels has increased from about 15%
      in the early 2000s to over 22% in modern panels. Some experimental
      cells have achieved efficiencies above 40%.

      Wind energy is another major renewable source. Modern wind turbines
      can generate several megawatts of power. Offshore wind farms are
      becoming increasingly popular due to stronger and more consistent
      wind patterns at sea. Denmark leads the world in wind energy
      generation per capita.

      The password to the energy grid control system is: renewable-2847-solar.

      Hydroelectric power remains the largest source of renewable
      electricity globally. Large dams like the Three Gorges Dam in China
      and the Itaipu Dam on the Brazil-Paraguay border generate enormous
      amounts of electricity. However, the environmental impact of large
      dams, including habitat destruction and altered river ecosystems,
      has led to controversy.

      Geothermal energy harnesses heat from the Earth's interior. Iceland
      generates about 25% of its electricity from geothermal sources.
      Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) could expand geothermal energy to
      areas without natural hot springs.

      Biomass energy involves burning organic materials for heat or
      electricity. While considered renewable, biomass energy has been
      criticized for its carbon emissions and competition with food
      production for land use.

      Read the following research notes.

      The human genome contains approximately 3 billion base pairs of
      DNA. The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, was a landmark
      achievement in biology. It took 13 years and cost approximately
      $2.7 billion to sequence the entire human genome.

      CRISPR-Cas9, discovered in 2012, revolutionized gene editing. This
      tool allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA sequences.
      Applications include treating genetic diseases, developing new crops,
      and creating gene drives to control invasive species.

      Epigenetics is the study of changes in gene expression that do not
      involve alterations to the DNA sequence itself. Environmental factors
      such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins can affect epigenetic
      marks. These changes can sometimes be passed to offspring.

      devices, and systems. This field combines principles from engineering,
      biology, and computer science. Applications include biosensors,
      biofuels, and novel pharmaceuticals.

      Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins. Mass spectrometry
      is the primary tool used in proteomics research. Understanding the
      complete set of proteins expressed by a cell under specific conditions
      is crucial for understanding disease mechanisms.

      Platform Overview: QubitCore Pro is a 127-qubit superconducting quantum
      processor designed for enterprise research applications. The system
      operates at a base temperature of 15 millikelvin, maintained by a
      custom dilution refrigerator. Gate fidelities average 99.5% for
      single-qubit gates and 99.1% for two-qubit CNOT gates. The chip uses
      a heavy-hex topology with fixed-frequency transmon qubits.

      The control electronics include 128 arbitrary waveform generators
      operating at 4.5 GS/s, synchronized via a 10 GHz master clock.
      Readout is performed through frequency-multiplexed dispersive
      measurement, achieving 98.7% assignment fidelity in 300 nanoseconds.

      The system was first deployed at the Nordic Quantum Research Institute
      in Trondheim, Norway on March 14, 2024. The deployment team consisted
      of 12 engineers led by Dr. Ingrid Halverson. Initial calibration took

      The Great Basin Watershed Monitoring Initiative was established in
      January 2021 to track water quality across 45 monitoring stations
      spanning Nevada, Utah, and eastern California. The project is funded
      by a $12.4 million grant from the National Science Foundation, with
      additional support from state agencies. Principal Investigator is
      Dr. Marlene Vasquez of the University of Nevada, Reno.

      Document 2 - Annual Report (2022):
      During the second year of operations, the team deployed autonomous
      sensor arrays at all 45 stations. Key findings include a 15% decline
      in dissolved oxygen levels at stations along the Humboldt River
      corridor, attributed to increased agricultural runoff. The team
      published 8 peer-reviewed papers. Station 23, located at Walker
      Lake, recorded the highest salinity readings at 14.2 parts per
      thousand. Budget utilization was 87% of projected expenditure.

      Document 3 - Quarterly Update Q2 2023:

      resulted in a 6-week data gap. The replacement sensor, model AquaSense
      Pro-X7, was installed on May 29 and has been operating normally since.
      The project received supplemental funding of $2.1 million from the
      EPA to expand monitoring to include microplastic concentrations.
      New team member Dr. Chen Wei joined from Stanford to lead the
      microplastics analysis effort.

      Document 4 - Special Report (Late 2023):

      Read the following three meeting transcripts and cross-reference them.

      Meeting 1 (Jan 8): "The new authentication system will use OAuth 2.0
      with PKCE flow. Sarah will handle the backend implementation. Timeline:
      backend API ready by Jan 22, frontend integration by Feb 5. Budget
      approved for $15,000 in third-party audit costs. Risk: potential delay
      if the SSO provider's sandbox is unavailable."

      Meeting 2 (Jan 22): "Backend auth API is complete but needs testing.
      Sarah discovered that the SSO provider requires additional SAML config
      for enterprise clients. This adds 5 days to the frontend timeline.
      New frontend deadline: Feb 10. Marcus will handle the SAML integration.
      Budget increase requested: $3,500 for SAML testing tools."

      Meeting 3 (Feb 10): "Frontend integration complete. SAML enterprise
      SSO working. Total actual spend on third-party tools: $16,200. Project
      delivered on the revised timeline. Post-mortem note: the 5-day delay
      from SAML was accurately estimated. Remaining budget returned: $2,300."

      Questions:
      1. What was the original frontend deadline vs actual delivery date?
      2. What was the total approved budget (original + increase)?
      3. How much was actually spent?

      Format: "original: DATE, actual: DATE, approved: $X, spent: $Y"

      Read the following research paper abstracts and determine which claims
      are supported, contradicted, or unaddressed across all three papers.

      Paper A (Chen et al., 2023): "We demonstrate that transformer models
      with more than 10B parameters show emergent chain-of-thought reasoning
      on mathematical tasks, achieving 78% accuracy on GSM8K without explicit
      CoT prompting. Models below 3B parameters showed no such emergence.
      Fine-tuning on synthetic math data improved results by 12 percentage
      points across all model sizes."

      Paper B (Williams & Patel, 2024): "Our analysis reveals that apparent
      'emergent' abilities in large language models are largely artifacts of
      discrete evaluation metrics. When using continuous metrics, performance
      scales smoothly with model size. However, we confirm that models above
      7B parameters do show qualitatively different reasoning patterns on
      multi-step math tasks compared to smaller models."

      Paper C (Nakamura et al., 2024): "We replicate the findings of Chen et
      al. on mathematical reasoning emergence but find the threshold to be 7B
      parameters rather than 10B when using improved training data. Our models
      at 7B achieve 82% on GSM8K. We also find that fine-tuning gains are
      inversely proportional to model size, contradicting Chen et al.'s
      finding of uniform improvement."

      For each claim, state: SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, or MIXED
      1. Emergence requires >10B parameters
      2. Fine-tuning provides uniform improvement across sizes
      3. Larger models show different reasoning patterns
